# ST Language Grammar in ANTLRv4

This repository contains a grammar for the **Structured Text (ST)** language, developed in **ANTLRv4** as part of my Master's thesis.

The project consists of a **lexer** and a **parser**, which together allow the generation of a **syntax tree** from a given piece of ST code.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Scope

The grammar is intended to support the basic ST syntax defined in the international standard:

> **IEC 61131-3 â€“ Second Edition (2003)**  
> *(Subject to change as the project evolves)*

Additionally, the grammar aims to support **CPDev-specific directives**, a system developed at **RzeszÃ³w University of Technology**.

## âœ… Things Done So Far

- âœ… Created a dedicated project branch  
- âœ… Set up IDE for ANTLRv4 development  
- âœ… Conducted research on available reference grammars  
  - Including the **IEC 61131-3 â€“ Second Edition** standard

---

## ðŸš§ Currently in Progress

- ðŸ›  Designing the **lexer**
- ðŸ›  Covering the full language specification

---

## ðŸ”œ To Do

- ðŸ§© Design a **parser** for simple input
- âž• Improve parser to support **basic math expressions**

---

## ðŸ“Ž Notes

This grammar is a work in progress and may evolve as more edge cases and syntax rules are discovered.
